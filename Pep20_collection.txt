//Generics	:
Collection	:Collection is class in java which can hold any type of data.
			:List. Set and Queue is the three child interface which extedns the Collection interface which is under java util package.
			:List is an interface no need to write New Keyword for memory allocation.
			:Arraylist, linked List, and Vector are class which can implements the List.
			:Arraylist allow dynamic memory allocation.
			:Arraylist is used when you have find any item in this term Arraylist is useful
			:Linked List is useful in case you want to add or delete some element in the list.
			:Inside Java Vector is known as Legacy collection which is synchronized and it is threadshafe.
			:All the data in the collection is type of object.
				Collection-->are three types is given Below
					|
		-------------------------
		/			|			\
	  List 		   Set			Queue
		
	List	:It can hold duplicate element.
	
					   List-->Can be implements using one of them.
						|
			-------------------------
			 /			|			\
		Arraylist   Linked List   Vector
			
	Set		:It can hold only unique element.
	
						   Set
							|
			----------------------------------
			 /				|				\
		Hash Set	Linked Hash Set      Tree Set
		
		Hash Set-->	:Collection of Hash set not be ordered and not be Shoted because it internally store data on the basis of hashcode.
					:It will creade bucket and store them in the bucket.
					:It will always read element from the first bucket.
					:It is used for faster searching.
		Linked HashSet--->	:In this collection data will be shorted and ordered.
		
		Tree Set-->	:It first implements shorted set and shorted set implements Set interface.
					:By default element are shorted in Tree set in natural order (Ascending Order).
					
		
			
	Queue	:It is similar like list but it follow First In First Out approach for data acceess.
	
							   Queue

				Priority queue			Linked List
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
	Generics--->	:Type of generic must be class type not premittive type.
					:Both side must be same.
					:retainAll() method is use to find intersection of two list and its return true or false.
